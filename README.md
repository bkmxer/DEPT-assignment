requirements to install and review the project and job done:
node 10.12.0
- npm i
- npm run start
- check localhost for /assignment.html


- Besides the requirements, worked on the accessibility, documentation, animations, transitions;

- Created components and utils (ex. validator, toast, modal(extended), subscription(extended));

- Did basic PWA setup fit

- Made a real endpoint AJAX call wit API utils

- simulating FAKE response if there's no string "DEPT" present in the form data (any field)

- investigated the possible translation mechanism (didn't have time to implement, but would go with filter approach): source/utilities/translator/README.md

- Added input validation and visual indication

- tried prototyping basic alt-color-scheme with native css variables approach
